# eventBouncer Task

This task acts like the bouncer of your GA4 party â€“ no uninvited events get through the door! ðŸŽ‰ Itâ€™s got eagle eyes for any sneaky, unexpected parameters trying to tag along with your events,
and theyâ€™ll get turned away at the gate too. ðŸš« No shady events here â€“ only the VIP events make it in! ðŸ˜Ž
  
# Parameters

 This task takes a schema of the events definition:
 The ```sharedEventParameters``` Array will hold a list of the parameters that may be included on any event. ( This way we don't need to defined them on each of the events )
 The ```events``` Object, holds the event guest list, any event coming through that is not on this list will be removed from the payload. We can defined also the ```wlep``` ( White Listed Event Parameters ) , which
 will check the enabled parameters for the current event. If the current event has a parameter that is not on the ```wlep``` or it's defined from the sharedEventParameters it will be removed from the event data.



 ```eventBouncerTask(requestModel, {{allowedEventsSchema}})```
